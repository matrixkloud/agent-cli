# AI Agent CLI Tools

This repository is a collection of installation guides and scripts for various AI coding assistants and development tools. It is designed to be a central hub for anyone who wants to get started with using AI tools in their development workflow.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can use the automated setup script to install all the tools and configure your environment. The script will guide you through the process of selecting the tools you want to install and configuring your API keys.
